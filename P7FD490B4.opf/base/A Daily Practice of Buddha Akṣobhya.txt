A Daily Practice of Buddha Akṣobhya
by Karma Chakmé

rangnyi chomden mitrukpa
I visualize myself as the Bhagavān Akṣobhya,
tulkü chaluk tsenpé dzok
Complete with the major and minor marks and in nirmāṇakāya garb,
langpö tri la shyukpar gom
And seated upon a throne supported by elephants.
tukkar da teng hung ting tar
At my heart, upon a moon-disc, is a blue hūṃ,
zung kyi yé su korwa lé
Around which the mantra rotates to the right,
özer tingkha rab tröpé
Sending out powerful rays of deep blue light.
tsedé tok drang dro kün gyi
Through this, I visualize, the karmic obscurations
lé kyi dribpa tamché ni
Of all sentient beings, especially of those who have passed away,
bamor nyizer pok tar gom
Disappear entirely, just like frost in sunlight!
