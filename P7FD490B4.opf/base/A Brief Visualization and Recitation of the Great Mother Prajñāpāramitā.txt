A Brief Visualization and Recitation of the Great Mother Prajñāpāramitā
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Having taken refuge and generated bodhicitta as a preliminary:
ah, nangsi dakpé shying chenpö
Āḥ. All that appears and exists is an immense pure realm,
ü su pema dawé teng
In the centre of which, upon a lotus and moon,
yumchen sherchin ser gyi dok
Is the Great Mother Prajñāpāramitā, gold in colour,
shyal chik chak shyi dangpo nyi
With one face and four hands—with which she holds
yepa dorjé yön puti
A vajra in the first right hand and a book in the first left,
tama nyi kyi nyamshyak dzé
While the remaining two rest in the gesture of equanimity.
dar dang rinchen gyen gyi dzé
She is adorned with the silk and jewel ornaments
dorjé kyilmo trung gi shyuk
And sits with legs crossed in the vajra posture.
né sum dru sum tuk ü su
Her three centres are marked with the three syllables
pé dar tuk sok ah yi tsen
And in her heart centre, upon a lotus and moon is an Āḥ,
dé tar ngak kyi trengwé kor
Surrounded by the rotating mantra garland,
ö trö dön nyi drubpar gyur
From which light radiates out to accomplish twofold benefit.
Recite the Gaté mantra:
teyata | om gaté gaté para gaté | para samgaté | bodhi soha
tadyathā | oṃ gate gate pāragate | pārasaṃgate | bodhi svāhā
When practising approach recite this four hundred thousand times.
At the end:
lhar nang ösal ngang la shyak
The deity appearance dissolves and I rest in a state of clear light.
Dedicate the virtue and recite prayers of aspiration.
